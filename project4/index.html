<h1>Part 1: Understanding the Forward and Reverse Diffusion Processes</h1>

<p>
In this part of the project, my goal was to understand how diffusion models add noise to an image 
(forward process) and how they recover the original structure (reverse denoising). I experimented 
with different noise levels, observed how the UNet predicts noise, and compared different denoising 
strategies such as one–step denoising, iterative denoising, and Gaussian blur. Below, I explain 
each subsection clearly in my own words along with the observations.
</p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h2>1.1 Forward Process (Adding Noise)</h2>

<p>
In this section, I applied the forward diffusion equation to the original image using three 
different timesteps (<b>t = 250, 500, 750</b>). As <i>t</i> increases, the amount of noise increases. 
The purpose of this experiment is to understand how diffusion models gradually corrupt an image.
</p>

<p><b>Observations:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>At lower <i>t</i> (250), the coarse structure of the tower is still visible.</li>
    <li>At medium noise (500), most details disappear and only rough shapes remain.</li>
    <li>At high noise (750), the image becomes almost pure Gaussian noise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 Gaussian Blur Baseline</h2>

<p>
Before using the diffusion model for denoising, I first used a simple Gaussian blur to see how 
well traditional filtering performs. This part helps to compare classical denoising with learned 
denoising.
</p>

<p><b>Observations:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Gaussian blur removes noise but also destroys the fine edges.</li>
    <li>The result looks like a smeared version of the original.</li>
    <li>Compared to diffusion denoising, this method cannot recover natural image structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.3 One–Step Denoising Using the UNet</h2>

<p>
Here, I used the diffusion model's UNet to predict the noise in a single step and subtract it from 
the noisy image. This is effectively the model’s estimate of <i>x<sub>0</sub></i> using Equation (2) 
from the DDPM paper.
</p>

<p><b>Observations:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The model reconstructs sharper edges compared to Gaussian blur.</li>
    <li>As noise increases, the UNet’s one–step prediction becomes less accurate.</li>
    <li>It still fails to fully reconstruct the image at high noise (e.g., t = 750).</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.4 Iterative Denoising (DDPM Reverse Process)</h2>

<p>
In this section, I implemented the full iterative DDPM denoising process using a strided schedule 
of timesteps (<code>[990, 960, ..., 0]</code>). Instead of predicting the clean image in one step, the 
model gradually reduces the noise over many steps.
</p>

<p><b>Observations:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The image gets progressively cleaner as we move through the timestep list.</li>
    <li>The iterative result is much sharper and smoother than the one–step reconstruction.</li>
    <li>It successfully reconstructs the tower structure even from very noisy inputs.</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>
Overall, Part 1 clearly demonstrates how diffusion models remove noise more effectively than 
classical filtering approaches, and how iterative denoising significantly improves reconstruction 
quality compared to one-step methods.
